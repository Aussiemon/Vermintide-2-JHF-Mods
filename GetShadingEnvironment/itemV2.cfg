title = "[Tool] Get Shading Environment";
description = "This mod allows you to export the rendering settings that compose your current shading environment.

A shading environment is a set of variables that control how your game appears; such as color of fog, wind speed, sun position, etc.

The file this tool exports is in the format Vermintide requires for its levels, allowing you to replace the rendering settings of one map with another.

Added command is:
[list]
[*] [b]/get_shading_environment[/b]
[/list]

Shading environments are exported to your game folder with a .shading_environment extension.
