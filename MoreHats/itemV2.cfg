title = "More Hats and Frames";
description = "Certain hats and frames are safely-equippable by other heroes. This mod adds unlocked cosmetics to those characters' equipment lists, and allows you to unequip both hats and frames by attempting to equip them again.

Equipped (and unequipped) hats and frames are visible to unmodded players in the lobby without issue. Some hats may display strangely on other characters.
