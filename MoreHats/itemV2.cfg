description = "Certain hats are safely-equippable by other heroes. This mod adds unlocked hats to those characters' equipment lists, and allows unequipping hats as if they were trinkets.

Equipped (and unequipped hats) are visible to unmodded players in the lobby without issue. Some hats may display strangely on other characters.";
